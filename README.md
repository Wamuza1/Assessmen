# Assessment

Self-Assessment:
    
  The crucial part was defining the project scope and gathering the data. 
  I did additional research to get the most recent data  set that was the requirement of this project.
  Although handling and retrieving the data, database and DataFrame was challenging. 
  I worked so hard and successfully would be able to get it done. I am feeling so proud of myself.

  Each team member clearly understands the group's performance and expectations.
  Our group has open, constructive discussions about disagreements or problems, and we were generally positive and motivated, even in difficult times.
  Each group member is equally committed to the group's success and understands how individual contribution relates to group performance. 

Brief summary of the project

Our group chose to analyze five different cryptocurrencies. 
Our goal  was  to compare their previous growth and track their trajectory in order to see which would be the lucrative value to invest in the future.
We chose  this topic because crypto is a modern market and people have curiosity to get more information about which one to invest in.
We hope to find the answer to see which currency would be the best value for a customer. 
The five we chose were: Bitcoin, DogeCoin Tether, Etherium, and XRP.
